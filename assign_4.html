    <h3>About Course</h3>
    Front-end web development is everything involving in programming 
    the user interface of a web application.
     Typically it refers to the HyperText Markup Language(HTML), Cascading 
     Style Sheets(CSS) and JavaScript portion of website 
     production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. 
     It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive 
     HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various different browsers,
     devices and screen sizes.
